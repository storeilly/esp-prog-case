# esp-prog-case
 A small 3D case to keep an ESP-PROG protected from the "elements" of a busy (untidy) workbench
 
 When I got my ESP-PROG it came as a bare board so I decided to put it in a box! Use as you will and let me know if you make it any better.
 The cover should fit the box and just touch the top of the buttons and hopefuly the material you print with has enough flexibility to allow for the 0.3mm of button travel.
